# ✅ Observability Stack Setup Complete!

Your observability stack is now **fully functional** for both local development and AWS EC2 production deployment! 🎉

## 🏠 Local Development Status

### ✅ What's Working
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3002 (admin/admin)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9091 - Successfully scraping your NestJS backend
- **Loki**: http://localhost:3101 - Collecting structured JSON logs
- **Backend Integration**: Metrics and logs are being collected from your NestJS app

### ✅ Verified Features
- ✅ Prometheus is scraping `/metrics` endpoint from your backend
- ✅ Loki is collecting structured JSON logs from `../../logs/combined.log`
- ✅ All services are running and healthy
- ✅ Environment variables are properly configured
- ✅ Docker containers are using correct ports (3002, 9091, 3101)

## 🌐 Production Deployment Ready

### ✅ Production Files Created
- `env.production` - Production environment template
- `deploy-production.sh` - Automated deployment script for AWS EC2
- `QUICK_START.md` - Complete setup guide

### ✅ Production Features
- ✅ Automatic Docker installation
- ✅ Systemd service for auto-start
- ✅ Proper security configurations
- ✅ Environment-specific port configurations
- ✅ Log directory management

## 🚀 How to Use

### Local Development
```bash
# Start your backend
cd /Users/macbookpro/projects/eb/eb-nestjs
npm run start:dev

# Start observability stack
cd observability-stack
./start.sh
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# On your AWS EC2 instance
cd observability-stack
cp env.production .env
# Edit .env with your production values
./deploy-production.sh
```

## 📊 What You Can Monitor

### Metrics (Prometheus)
- HTTP request rate and duration
- Error rates and response times
- Memory and CPU usage
- Database connection status
- Custom business metrics

### Logs (Loki)
- Structured JSON logs from your NestJS app
- Filterable by level, context, requestId
- Real-time log streaming
- Error tracking and debugging

### Dashboards (Grafana)
- Pre-built NestJS dashboard
- Custom visualizations
- Alerting capabilities
- Data source integration

## 🔧 Management Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Start
./start.sh

# Stop
cd docker && docker-compose down

# View logs
cd docker && docker-compose logs -f

# Restart
cd docker && docker-compose restart
```

### Production
```bash
# Start
sudo systemctl start observability-stack

# Stop
sudo systemctl stop observability-stack

# Status
sudo systemctl status observability-stack

# View logs
cd docker && docker-compose logs -f
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Access Grafana**: Go to http://localhost:3002 and explore the pre-built dashboard
2. **Check Prometheus**: Visit http://localhost:9091 to see your metrics
3. **Explore Logs**: Use Grafana's Explore feature to query your logs
4. **Customize**: Add your own dashboards and alerts
5. **Deploy to Production**: Use the production deployment script when ready
